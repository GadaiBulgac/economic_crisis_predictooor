# economic_crisis_predictooor

The goal of this project is to use different computer models to predict banking crises using different indices of data for various Latin American countries. Latin America was chosen for this analysis because of its often storied economic history. Data from The World Bank, the Heritage Foundation’s Economic Freedom Index, the Fraser Institute’s Economic Freedom Index, and Reinhart and Rogoff’s dataset recording economic crises for their book “This Time Is Different” was used for the generation of these models. The following program was used to generate the computer model to predict banking crises: Python with TensorFlow and Keras machine learning libraries.
